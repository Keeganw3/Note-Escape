## About the Game
Space Race was originally made by Atari in 1973. Note Escape is our version of this very simple games. It’s a single player game. The idea is to get the avatar to the top of the map having avoided the music note debris to gain a point. There is a time limit in which at least one point needs to be gained to advance to the next, more daunting level. Game ends when you die or the time's up.
